I am using the second edition of the textbook.

A. ebp+8 is the pointer points to result
   ebp+12 is s1.a
   ebp+16 is s1.p
B. esp stores the address of s2
   esp+4 stores s1.a
   esp+8 stores s1.p
   esp+12 stores s2.sum
   esp+16 stores s2.diff
C. The values in the struct are stored in the order of increaing address on the stack, just like passing to parameters.
D. Space is prepared for the returned struct in the outer function. A pointer at the start of this space is passed into the inner function. The inner function can set the values of the struct before the inner function returns.

A. e1.p:0
   e1.y:4
   e2.x:0
   e2.next:4
B. 8
C. up->e2.next->e1.y = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up->e2.x
