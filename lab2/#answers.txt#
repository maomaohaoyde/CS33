6.Suppose we assume -fwrapv is used. Suggest changes to how Emacs does integer \
multiplication that should help improve its performance. Focus on integer multi\
plication; don't alter the machinery Emacs uses to decide which flavor of multi\
plication to do.
Get rid of the if statement. The result will be wrapped when overflow happens s\
o there is no need to deal with it in the source code.


7.How significant are the efficiency differences discussed above, in the contex\
t of Emacs execution?
The effiency difference is pretty significant since there are number of instruc\
tions in the if statement and one of them is multiplication which takes more ti\
me.
